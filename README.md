## Abstract
Emotion recognition in text is a fundamental aspect of natural language understanding, with significant applications in various domains such as mental health monitoring, customer feedback analysis, content recommendation systems, and chatbots. In this paper, we present a hybrid model for predicting the presence of six emotions: anger, disgust, fear, sadness, happiness, and surprise in Persian text. We also predict the primary emotion in the given text, including these six emotions and the ‚Äúother‚Äù category. Our approach involves the utilization of XLM-RoBERTa, a pre-trained transformer-based language model, and fine-tuning it on two diverse datasets: EmoPars and ArmanEmo. Central to our approach is incorporating a single Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (BiGRU), placed before the final fully connected layer. This strategic integration empowers our model to capture contextual dependencies more effectively, resulting in an improved F-score after adding this BiGRU layer. This enhanced model achieved a 2% improvement in the F-score metric on the ArmanEmo test set and a 7% improvement in the F-score metric for predicting the presence of six emotions on the final test set of the ParsiAzma Emotion Recognition competition.

## Goals

### 1. Predicting All Emotions Existence:
for each of the 6 classes, predict a binary label, meaning either the emotion is present in the given text or not. 
The emotions we consider are:
 - Anger
 - Disgust
 - Fear
 - Sadness
 - Happiness
 - Surprise

### 2. Predicting the Primary Emotion within 7 classes:
Predicting a single emotion that primarily represents the emotion of the given text within those 6 classes, along with an additional 'other' class for cases when the given text does not belong to one of those 6 classes.

## Datasets
The utilized dataset for this study includes two publicly available Datasets:
- ArmanEmo Dataset: [Link](https://github.com/arman-rayan-sharif/arman-text-emotion)
- EmoPars Dataset: [Link](https://github.com/nazaninsbr/Persian-Emotion-Detection)

## How to do the prediction
```
AE_PATH = 'model_ae.pth'
PE_PATH = 'model_pe.pt'

checkpoint_ae = torch.load(AE_PATH, map_location=torch.device('cpu'))
model_ae.load_state_dict(checkpoint_ae)

checkpoint_pe = torch.load(PE_PATH, map_location=torch.device('cpu'))
model_pe.load_state_dict(checkpoint_pe)

pe_predict(test_file,model_pe,tokenizer)
pe_prediction = pe_predict(test_file,model_pe,tokenizer)
ae_prediction = ae_predict(test_file,model_ae,tokenizer)

ae_prediction['primary_emotion'] = pe_prediction['primary_emotion']
final_result.to_csv('final_result.csv')

```
## Model Checkpoints Availability
TODO: It will be available on Huggingface soon.
